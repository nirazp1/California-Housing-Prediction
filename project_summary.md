## Data Cleaning Steps:
- Standardized column names across all datasets
- Handled missing values using mean/median imputation
- Converted date formats to ISO standard
- Removed duplicate listings from scraped data
- Standardized location data (zip codes, county names)

## Integration Process:
- Merged datasets using zip codes as primary keys
- Created calculated fields for analysis
- Validated data consistency across sources
- Generated summary statistics for quality control

The final dataset contains comprehensive housing information for California, including price trends, demographic factors, and policy impacts, ready for detailed analysis.
